A few months ago I finally got the courage to attend a meet-up. Since I'm a lot older and probably (certainly) less cooler than the typical programmer, I wanted to attend a meet-up as a wallflower. The Los Angeles Ruby Meetup group happen to be having a meetup with presentations that very month. Since I could kind of was able to follow the presentation titles and figured all eyes would be on the presenters, I decided this would be the perfect first time opportunity to attend a meetup!

After cooking dinner, cleaning the house, and putting my two young kids in bed (sounds just like a totally cool web developer, eh?), I hopped into my soccer van and headed over to the meetup. Butterflies and all, I headed up to the meetup 15 minutes late (completely intentional as to avoid the beginning mixer period).
