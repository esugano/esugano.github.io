To be honest, I'm not sure I want to be a web developer. I mean, I've always thought it was fun. I enjoy learning new languages and being challenged to think differently than I normally would. Its thrilling to build things (lame as it was, I was so proud when I built my Tic Tac Toe game in Ruby this week!). The job prospects are attractive: in-demand, pays well, flexiblity, etc. But do I really want to be a web developer? I guess I don't know yet... 

I signed up for Flatiron because I enjoy the coding that I've experienced so far. I'll have to finish the course to see if that still is the case. If so, then I'd probably want to be a web developer because I like it. If not, well, its been fun while it lasted!
