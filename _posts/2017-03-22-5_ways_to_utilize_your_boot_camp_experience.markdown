1) Review your code
 At the end of each project I try to go back and review my code. I look to see how I can make my code cleaner and more efficient. I've also reviewed my code with a Learn mentor to get feedback and tips as well. 
 
2) Swap Codes
 I've hit up Slack and Study Groups to find others that are in similar levels as me. I ask them to swap codes after each project. Then I like to compare and contrast to see how my code can be improved. 
 
3) Meetups
 I know that I'm pretty fortunate to live in a tech-friendly city and there are a ton of local meetups. I love to meet people of all expertise and backgrounds. 
 
4) Code different languages simulatously 
 To prevent forgetting, I try to go through my Learn lessons 3x a week and then use one day to go over other languages from other resources. For example, while I was working through the Intro to Ruby course in Learn, I was also going through Codeacademy's Javascript path to prevent forgetting my (very) basic Javascript skills. 
 
5) Side Project - I've been told the best experience is to build a side project from scratch. I'm still thinking what I want my side project to be so... let me know if you have any ideas! :)
